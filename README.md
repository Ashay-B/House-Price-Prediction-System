Step 1 : Do EDA for your Data and Cleaned it by taking reference from  EDA.ipynb

Step 2 : Split Your Data in Train and Test by data_split_and_visualization.ipynb and have look by visualizing it to                 
         see where the train and test data graph looks similar 

Step 3 : Now Handle Object data for better performance of your classification model using object_data_handling.ipynb

Step 4 : Feature scalling is needed for more accuracy and fast response here we did it for ocean proximity where  
         each feature is scaled into separate column
Step 5 : Now Build a  pipeline by deciding which model suits your data and gives more accuracy main.py

step 6 : Its Time to Create final pipeline and output to be saved in another csv using new_main.py
